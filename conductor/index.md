## What is Dex RoboKnix?

Dex RoboKnix is a cyberpunk framework for building cutting-edge cognitive tools through systematic knowledge transformation. It uses a **bidirectional value cascade** to decompose systems, extract assets, and build new tools.

## Core Framework

### Understanding Dex

- **[BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md](../BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md)** ⭐ - Complete conceptual architecture
  - Values → Principles → Policy → Process → Procedure → Pattern
  - Decomposition (top-down) and recomposition (bottom-up)
  - Asset inventory and critical gaps

- **[Product Overview](./product.md)** - What Dex RoboKnix is and why it exists

- **[Vision](./vision.md)** - Long-term direction and goals

### How We Work

- **[Workflow](./workflow.md)** - Development processes and rhythms
  - Divergent-convergent cadence
  - Track-based development
  - Documentation as discovery

- **[Tech Stack](./tech-stack.md)** - Technical decisions and rationale
  - Languages: Python, JavaScript
  - Paradigm: Documentation-first, TDD when building
  - Tools: Git, markdown, terminal-first

- **[Code Style Guides](./code_styleguides/)**
  - [Python Style Guide](./code_styleguides/python.md)
  - [JavaScript Style Guide](./code_styleguides/javascript.md)

### Active Work

- **[Tracks Registry](./tracks.md)** - All active and completed tracks
- **[Tracks Directory](./tracks/)** - Individual track workspaces
- **[Further Work Backlog](./further-work.md)** - Organized by value cascade layers

## Quick Start

### For Understanding Dex RoboKnix
1. Read [BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md](../BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md) (the complete framework)
2. Read [Product Overview](./product.md) (the why)
3. Explore [Ruliad](../../../Dex_RoboKnix_Ruliad/) (example product)

### For Building a New Product
1. Follow [Procedure Layer in BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md](../BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md#layer-5-procedure)
2. Use "Creating a New Dex RoboKnix Product" checklist
3. Run knowledge extraction protocol
4. Create conductor/ structure in new repo

### For Contributing to Framework
1. Identify gap in BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md or [Further Work](./further-work.md)
2. Create track in [tracks/](./tracks/)
3. Work through track phases
4. Update living docs with learnings

## Key Concepts

### The Bidirectional Data Framework
```
VALUES ←→ PRINCIPLES ←→ POLICY ←→ PROCESS ←→ PROCEDURE ←→ PATTERN
```
Every layer is an asset. Decompose downward, recompose upward. The framework exhibits bidirectional data flow as a core pattern.

### Asset-Based Knowledge Work
Transform thinking into reusable, composable, versioned assets. Each layer of the cascade produces capturable value.

### Cognition-Lead, LLM-Widen
Human provides direction, judgment, creativity. LLMs expand scope, challenge assumptions, accelerate research, document thinking.

### Cyberpunk Toolbuilding
Build cutting-edge tools that exploit knowledge structures. Reverse-engineering is co-equal with forward-engineering. All data is valid; transformation creates value.
