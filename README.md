## What is This?

**Dex RoboKnix** is both a methodology and a framework for creating cognitive tools that exploit knowledge structures.

It's built on the **Bidirectional Data Framework** — a six-layer system for decomposing complex systems into observable patterns (top-down) and recomposing patterns into actionable frameworks (bottom-up).

```
VALUES ←→ PRINCIPLES ←→ POLICY ←→ PROCESS ←→ PROCEDURE ←→ PATTERN
```

**Each layer is an asset.** Each transformation between layers creates value.

## Core Philosophy

### All Data is Valid

Inspired by Social Field Computing: treat all signals equally at collection. Value emerges through *transformation*, not from privileged sources.

> "If we're building a machine to find lost cats, a signal from one person saying they haven't seen the cat is just as valuable as having seen the cat."

### Transformation is the Asset

Traditional approaches optimize for outcomes. Dex optimizes for *capturing the transformation process itself* as reusable, composable assets.

### Cyberpunk Toolbuilding

- DIY cutting-edge technology
- Reverse-engineer and exploit knowledge structures
- Terminal-first aesthetics
- Open by default (GPL v3)

### Cognition-Lead, LLM-Widen

Human provides direction, judgment, and creative leaps. LLMs expand scope, challenge assumptions, accelerate research, and document thinking.

## Quick Start

### Understand the Framework

1. **[BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md](./BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md)** ⭐ — Complete conceptual architecture
2. **[conductor/product.md](./conductor/product.md)** — What Dex is and why it exists
3. **[conductor/index.md](./conductor/index.md)** — Navigation hub

### See It In Action

**[Ruliad Swarm](https://github.com/danichese/Dex_RoboKnix_Ruliad)** — Multi-agent "synthetic boardroom" (Product #1)
- 8 parallel agents exploring problems from orthogonal angles
- Built using Dex framework
- Demonstrates Bidirectional Data Framework in practice

### Build Something

1. Read [BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md](./BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md) Layer 5: PROCEDURE
2. Follow "Creating a New Dex RoboKnix Product" checklist
3. Run knowledge extraction protocol
4. Create your own cognitive tool

## The Bidirectional Value Cascade

### Decomposition (Top-Down)

Start with abstract values, progressively concretize into observable patterns:

```
VALUES          — What we believe/stand for
   ↓ Translation
PRINCIPLES      — How we think/decide
   ↓ Specification
POLICY          — What we mandate/allow
   ↓ Operationalization
PROCESS         — How we organize work
   ↓ Codification
PROCEDURE       — Specific steps/actions
   ↓ Execution
PATTERN         — Observable behaviors/data
```

### Recomposition (Bottom-Up)

Start with observed data, progressively abstract into discovered values:

```
PATTERN         — What we observe
   ↑ Inference
PROCEDURE       — What steps exist
   ↑ Generalization
PROCESS         — What workflows emerge
   ↑ Standardization
POLICY          — What constraints apply
   ↑ Abstraction
PRINCIPLES      — What patterns of thinking appear
   ↑ Synthesis
VALUES          — What we actually believe
```

**Both directions create assets at every layer.**

## The Conductor System

**Purpose:** Orchestrate complex projects without losing context.

**Structure:**
```

├── index.md              # Navigation hub
├── product.md            # What this product is
├── vision.md             # Long-term direction
├── tech-stack.md         # Technical decisions
├── workflow.md           # How we work
├── tracks.md             # Track registry
├── further-work.md       # Organized backlog (by cascade layer)
├── tracks/               # Active work
│   └── [track-name]/
│       ├── index.md      # Context
│       ├── spec.md       # Requirements
│       ├── plan.md       # Phased implementation
│       └── metadata.json # Status tracking
└── code_styleguides/     # Language conventions
    ├── python.md
    └── javascript.md
```

**Philosophy:** Documentation IS the work during conceptual phases. Code follows understanding.

## Key Concepts

### Asset-Based Knowledge Work

Every layer of the cascade produces capturable value:
- **VALUES** → Core beliefs (reusable across products)
- **PRINCIPLES** → Thinking frameworks (transferable)
- **POLICY** → Design mandates (composable)
- **PROCESS** → Workflows (duplicatable)
- **PROCEDURE** → Specific steps (executable)
- **PATTERN** → Observed data (queryable)

Assets are **reusable**, **composable**, **queryable**, **versioned**, and **transferable**.

### Computational Irreducibility

From Wolfram's Ruliad: some problems cannot be predicted, only computed. Applied to knowledge work:
- Don't predict what will work; run the process
- Parallel exploration > serial optimization
- Tools should enable exploration, not just execution

### Reverse Engineering as Method

The cascade works **both directions**:
- Forward: decompose existing values into concrete patterns
- Backward: extract principles from observed behaviors
- Find exploits in knowledge structures (cyberpunk ethos)

## Why Dex RoboKnix?

Traditional productivity tools optimize for *doing more, faster*.

Dex RoboKnix optimizes for **tools that help you think**:
- Make implicit thinking explicit
- Capture transformations, not just outcomes
- Learn while building (tools as learning vehicles)
- Generate reusable assets from every session

Built for:
- **Cyberpunk toolbuilders** who want DIY cognitive infrastructure
- **Knowledge workers** navigating complexity and ambiguity
- **Learners** who want tools that teach while they work
- **Reverse engineers** who decompose and rebuild systems
