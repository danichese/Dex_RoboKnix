# Session Handover: Portfolio Visual Overhaul

## Executive Summary

Started as visual README overhaul. Evolved into foundational restructure after discovering that Dex RoboKnix (entity) was conflated with Bidirectional Data Framework (tool). Created DEX_ROBOKNIX.md as new top-of-hierarchy document. Added "Attention Sovereignty" as fifth VALUE.

---

## What Was Completed

### 1. Recomposition Work
Traced PATTERN→VALUES through all documentation to discover Dex identity:
- Reviewed 5 markdown files (1775 lines total)
- Extracted PR #1 history for context
- Identified 12 terminology inconsistencies
- Found 6 broken links in conductor/index.md

### 2. Created DEX_ROBOKNIX.md

New foundational document defining the **entity** (not the methodology):

**VALUES (5):**
| Value | Core Meaning |
|-------|--------------|
| Extended Self | Dex = danichese + Claude Code as cognitive unit |
| Learning Over Production | Tools make you smarter, not faster |
| Making as Becoming | You grow by building |
| Visible Thinking | Documentation IS the work |
| Attention Sovereignty | Reclaim control from tech platforms |

**PRINCIPLES (5):**
- Build for yourself first
- Human lead, AI widen
- Thinking is the primary asset
- Serve the committed, not the curious
- Emergence over prediction

**POLICY (5):**
- Open by default (GPL v3)
- Terminal-first, web optional
- Polyrepo structure
- Methodology-driven development
- Self-first development

### 3. Partial Terminology Fixes

Fixed in BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md:
- Line 83: "Bidirectional Value Cascade" → "Bidirectional Data Framework"
- Line 129: "bidirectional Bidirectional Data Framework" → "Bidirectional Data Framework"
- Line 355: "Value cascade extraction" → "Framework extraction"

---

## What Remains (Not Done)

### Terminology Fixes Needed

| File | Line | Current | Should Be |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md | 358 | "Bidirectional Bidirectional Data Framework" | "Bidirectional Data Framework" |
| BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md | 450 | "Bidirectional Bidirectional Data Framework framework" | "Bidirectional Data Framework" |
| BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md | 489 | "Value cascade document" | "Framework document" |
| conductor/product.md | 12 | "bidirectional Bidirectional Data Framework" | "Bidirectional Data Framework" |
| conductor/product.md | 159 | "Bidirectional Value Cascade" | "Bidirectional Data Framework" |
| conductor/product.md | 256 | "Value cascade framework" | "Bidirectional Data Framework" |
| conductor/index.md | 9 | "bidirectional value cascade" | "Bidirectional Data Framework" |
| conductor/index.md | 48 | "value cascade layers" | "framework layers" |
| conductor/index.md | 58 | "value cascade methodology" | "Bidirectional Data Framework" |

### Broken Links in conductor/index.md

| Line | Reference | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 26 | `./vision.md` | Does not exist |
| 35 | `./tech-stack.md` | Does not exist |
| 40-42 | `./code_styleguides/*.md` | Do not exist |
| 46 | `./tracks.md` | Does not exist |
| 47 | `./tracks/` | Does not exist |
| 61 | `./products-pipeline.md` | Does not exist |

### Document Updates Needed

1. **BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md** - Reframe as tool-within-Dex (currently claims to define what Dex IS)
2. **conductor/product.md** - Update with entity/tool distinction
3. **conductor/index.md** - Update with correct hierarchy, fix broken links
4. **README.md** - Visual polish (deferred until internal structure solid)

## Key Insights From Session

### 1. Hierarchy Clarification

```
DEX_ROBOKNIX.md (Entity - TOP)
    │
    ├── Built the POLICY layer that created...
    │
    └── BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md (Methodology - TOOL)
            │
            └── Which can be applied at ALL levels
                including to build itself (self-referential)
```

"Plane built while flying" - retroactive planning for recursive improvement.

### 2. Attention Sovereignty (New VALUE)

From user observation about social media reels:
> "Scrolling reels sets expectation for reaction after 30 seconds, control decided by tech company. Laugh then see evil half minute later."

This revealed missing VALUE: **Entropic control over attention**. Tech platforms own your cognitive cadence. Dex tools reclaim it. Terminal-first = attention-first.

### 3. Why This Session Reasoned Deeply

User identified: "high training signal prompting"

**Mechanics that worked:**
- Structured spec.md with clear sections and visual mandates
- Previous session context preserved in spec
- Framework (BDF) provided reasoning scaffold
- Iterative refinement rather than one-shot
- BDF is self-referential: used to build itself up from PROCESS→VALUES

### 4. Entity Class Pattern (Shadow Work)

Conceptual, not for public docs yet:
- Cloning = instantiating yourself as the entity
- Requires setting yourself as entity class
- Email registration for research capture
- Shadow repo → enterprise artifacts with "middle finger" pricing

---

## Future Work Ideas

### Immediate Next Session

1. Complete terminology fixes (9 remaining)
2. Fix/comment broken links in conductor/index.md
3. Reframe BIDIRECTIONAL_DATA_FRAMEWORK.md as tool

### Ruliad Integration

1. Review Ruliad conductor file with BDF lens
2. Use BDF to build scope for conductor changes
3. Update conductor including tracks for in-flight changes
4. Create secondary artifact: conductor setup boilerplate

### Cross-Platform Conductor

1. Build spec.md boilerplate for Gemini CLI
2. Make conductor configurable for different AI services
3. Allow exact spec but with Claude Code / Gemini CLI / other backends

## For Ikem

If showing this to Ikem, key points:

1. **Dex RoboKnix is an entity, not a framework** - it's danichese + Claude Code as cognitive unit
2. **Bidirectional Data Framework is a tool** - sits within Dex, not equal to Dex
3. **5 VALUES** - Extended Self, Learning > Production, Making as Becoming, Visible Thinking, Attention Sovereignty
4. **Self-referential** - the framework builds itself, the tools build themselves
5. **Cyberpunk = reclaiming control** - from tech platforms, from attention theft, from cognitive colonization

---

**Status:** Handover ready for next session
**Next Action:** Complete terminology fixes, then visual polish
